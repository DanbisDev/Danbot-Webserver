# Old School RuneScape Clan Bingo Tracker

This project is a Discord bot designed for tracking bingo events in Old School RuneScape clans.

## Overview

The bot provides real-time tracking of bingo games, making it easy for clan members to keep up with the progress of the event. It's designed to be easy to use, with commands for starting games, updating scores, and displaying the current game status.

This bot makes use of discord webhooks and the Dink plugin. For the dink settings import, see the dink_settings.txt in the root directory. To import these settings, enable the dink plugin from the plugin hub and type ::dinkimport. Then make sure you create your own discord webhook and set the primary webhook setting to your webhook.
